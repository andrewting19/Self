      <h2>Meet Andrew:</h2> He's a senior at Trinity School living in New York City.
        <br>He's 17 years old, and his favorite classes this year
        <br>are Art, Asian Literature, Computer Science, Economics,
        <br>Mandarin, & Physics. He has no idea what he wants to do
        <br>as a career. But maybe in college that's what he'll find out. <br>
        <br>He likes Studio Ghibli films, eating snacks,
        <br>doing well in school, and making people laugh.<br>
        <br> His goal is to make 1000 cranes by the time he
        <br> graduates. He also hopes to get into college.
